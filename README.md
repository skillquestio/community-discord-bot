# Discord Bot Boilerplate

This repo is a jumping-off place for building a Discord bot, published by [Skillquest](https://skillquest.io). We'll get your Discord bot running within an hour. Full tutorial for getting started and building the bot on Skillquest. If you want to learn more about adding skills to this bot, creating games, making a chat widget, etc... join Skillquest and show what you can do!

## Requirements

- A [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) account for running the server and modifying code
- A [Discord](https://discord.com/) account for creating a bot, server, and inviting that bot to your server

## What a bot can do

You can teach your bot to do anything on Discord that a human can do, and more. You can do simple things, such as...

- Sending messages
- Adding reactions
- Adding/deleting voice channels

and automate it all. So the limit is really your imagination.

## Steps

- Get accounts (see: Requirements)
- Import this project to Glitch
- Get bot credentials from Discord
- Create a Discord server
- Invite your bot to the server
- Make your first change to the code. Here are some simple ideas:
  - Reply to a message
  - React to a message
  - DM users when they join
- Host the bot in the cloud
- Make it do something complex. The power in Discord is integrating with other things! Here are some ideas:
  - Track how many users are on throughout the day
  - Make it get and return data from another source, like ranks for a video game
  - Make it play a game with your users
  - Roulette that bans someone from the Discord when you use a command
  - Join a channel and play music
  - Record audio from a channel
  - Manage messages (clean out a channel, edit an announcement message, etc...)
